# VCH MRI Booking System

## Project Overview
A solution prototype utilizing AWS-managed Natural Language Processing (NLP) services: AWS Comprehend and AWS Comprehend Medical. A rules-based algorithm uses requisition samples to predict a output P-value based on the submitted criteria on MRI requisition that will help assign patients to an MRI site with the fastest turnaround time. This optimization will aim to decrease the current wait-list time and increase the number of patients who receive their exam within benchmarked wait times.
